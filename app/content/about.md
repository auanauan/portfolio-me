Hello! I'm Thanakrit Mangkang, a hobbyist developer based in Bangkok, Thailand. 
I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, and modern frameworks like React, Vue, Nuxt, and Next.js. 
I also have experience with C#. 
Outside of programming, I enjoy watching TV series and keeping active through workouts.
