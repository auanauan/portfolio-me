        Hello! I'm Thanakrit Mangkang, a hobbyist developer based in Thailand.
    While I primarily work with JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and Go, I'm also comfortable with lower-level languages like
C# and others. Outside of programming, I enjoy watching TV series and staying active through workouts.
